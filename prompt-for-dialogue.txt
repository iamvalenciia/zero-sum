    "topic_context": "One of the most important operations involving matrices is multiplication of two
matrices. e matrix product of matrices A and B is a third matrix C. In order for this
product to be defined, A must have the same number of columns as B has rows. If A is of
shape m × n and B is of shape n × p, then C is of shape m × p. We can write the matrix
product just by placing two or more matrices together, for example,
e product operation is defined by
Note that the standard product of two matrices is not just a matrix containing the
product of the individual elements. Such an operation exists and is called the elementwise product, or Hadamard product, and is denoted as A ⊙ B.
e dot product between two vectors x and y of the same dimensionality is the matrix
product x⊤y. We can think of the matrix product C = AB as computing Ci,j as the dot
product between row i of A and column j of B.
Matrix product operations have many useful properties that make mathematical
analysis of matrices more convenient. For example, matrix multiplication is distributive:
It is also associative:
Matrix multiplication is not commutative (the condition AB = BA does not always hold),
unlike scalar multiplication. However, the dot product between two vectors is
commutative:
e transpose of a matrix product has a simple form:
is enables us to demonstrate equation 2.8 by exploiting the fact that the value of such a
product is a scalar and therefore equal to its own transpose:
Since the focus of this textbook is not linear algebra, we do not attempt to develop a
comprehensive list of useful properties of the matrix product here, but the reader should
be aware that many more exist.
We now know enough linear algebra notation to write down a system of linear
equations:
where A ∈ ℝm×n is a known matrix, b ∈ ℝm is a known vector, and x ∈ ℝ
n is a vector of
unknown variables we would like to solve for. Each element xi of x is one of these
unknown variables. Each row of A and each element of b provide another constraint. We
can rewrite equation 2.11 as
or even more explicitly as
Matrix-vector product notation provides a more compact representation for equations
of this form"
