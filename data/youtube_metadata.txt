1. The Geometry of Machine Learning: L1 vs L2 vs L-infinity Norms
2. Why "Size" is Subjective in Math (And Why It Matters for AI)
3. Vector Norms Visually Explained: From Euclidean to Frobenius

DESCRIPTION:

Measuring the "size" of a vector isn’t as simple as it looks. In fact, choosing the wrong way to measure distance can completely break your machine learning model.

In this video, we dive deep into Vector Norms—the mathematical engine behind regularization, error metrics, and optimization. We break down the differences between L1, L2, and L-infinity norms, visualize why L1 creates sparsity (and why that matters), and explain how the "geometry of choice" shapes everything in deep learning.

If you’ve ever wondered why we use Mean Squared Error squared or why L1 regularization leads to feature selection, this visual guide is for you.
